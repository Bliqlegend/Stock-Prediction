**Aim**: `Predict Stocks with Stats`


**Objective**: 
	
		>> To predict the stock prices to near accuracy and help predict the prices way better.
	
		>> Its good for beginners and simulation players to understand the prediction methods and gaining confidence.

**Proposed Idea**:

>> Takes last 5 days of data from API and stores it into JSON format.


>> Then Runs over a loop on the data, and generate a graph for predicting.


>> splits data into test data and train data.


>> Try to create model using train data.


>> Check accuracy using test data and print out the Percentage Accuracy of prediction,


>> Prints out the predicted data acc to the user input of time.

**Tech Used**:

		>> Python,Sklearn

**Motivation** :
		
		
		>> There are not many models to predict the data effectively.
		>> It can save you from broker charges from the companies for this sole purpose.
		>> To save losses for beginners and to increase profit for experienced people.
